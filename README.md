This is the new JS version of ProseMaker, which will eventually officially
become ProseMaker 3.0.

To develop:

- clone via git    
- install dependencies with `npm install`
- edit code, occasionally running `npm run lint`
- compile and test with `npm run dev` (or `npm run` and peruse the list)

Commands to do that:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/DanielBaird/prosemaker.git
cd prosemaker
npm install
# edit stuff...
npm run lint
npm run dev
```
