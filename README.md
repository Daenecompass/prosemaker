Originally part of the CliMAS project: https://github.com/jcu-eresearch/climas-ng .

23 October 2015: Moved improvements made as part of the CliMAS NG project back into this repo, which is now up to date with the version of ProseMaker I presented at the eResearch Australasia 2015 conference in October.  It currently runs in Python 2.7, but not 3.x.

15 January 2015: Started a JavaScript version based on PEG.js.

To develop:

- clone via git    
- install dependencies with `npm install`
- edit code, occasionally running `npm run lint`
- compile and test with `npm run dev` (or `npm run` and peruse the list)

Commands to do that:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/DanielBaird/prosemaker.git
cd prosemaker
npm install
# edit stuff...
npm run lint
npm run dev
```
