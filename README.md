Document assembly for scientific reporting


This has been rewritten in Python, and current development is happening inside the CliMAS NG project: https://github.com/jcu-eresearch/climas-ng .  Once I wrap up CliMAS NG, I'll move prosemaker into its own egg (or whatever the hell python will be using for distribution by then) that will be in this repo.

22 October 2015: Now moving CliMAS improvements back into this repo.  I presented ProseMaker at a conference recently so in theory I have a lot of material that could go into this readme...
