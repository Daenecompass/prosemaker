Originally part of the CliMAS project: https://github.com/jcu-eresearch/climas-ng .

23 October 2015: Moved CliMAS improvements back into this repo, which is now up to date with the version of ProseMaker I presented at the eResearch Australasia 2015 conference a few days ago.  It currently runs in Python 2.7, but not 3.x, so that's probably my next goal.
